# AsteroidMath
A small module written in the Asteroid language to help me do Calculus II homework. Skip to the "global functions" section if you simply want to know how to use

## Integral structure:
### Member variables
- a - lower bounds of definite integral
- b - upper bounds of definite integral
- f - the integrand; function (as a first-class citizen) being integrated
- Dx - change (delta) in x value until next rectangle is calculated (for when calculating the integral); calculated in the constructor
- p - number of parts the function is split into for the approximation
### Member functions
- Constructor - uses multi-dispatching to see if “parts” parameter (integer) is given or not (determines how many times the integral is being split up for approximations: in other words, how many rectangles there are)
- calc_Dx - re-calculates the change in x value (Dx) based on bounds and number of parts
- dec_b - calculates a new upper bound by decrementing Dx from the old upper bound; returns new Integral instance

## Global functions
I could've made these methods of the Integral structure, but I elected not to for now. The module works as-is, and any efforts to simplify it is extra work I unfortunately don't have time for right now. 
- left(I:%Integral) - left-hand integral approximation. Has a recursive version of itself inside of it which includes an additional total parameter. 
- right(I:%Integral) - right-hand integral approximation. Has a recursive version of itself inside of it which includes an additional total parameter. 
- mid(I:%Integral) - midline integral approximation. Has a recursive version of itself inside of it which includes an additional total parameter. 
- trap(I:%Integral) - trapezoid integral approximation. Has a recursive version of itself inside of it which includes an additional total parameter. 
- simp(I:%Integral) - integral approximation using Simpson's rule. Has a recursive version of itself inside of it which includes an additional total parameter.
